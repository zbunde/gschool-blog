We started working in sinatra this week. Building an app from scratch and using capybara to test it. Capybara is really nice
for testing user interaction without having to run through the browser. I also learned about the gem rerun which is super helpful
for relaunching the local server without having to drop and restart it. I am spending my time outside of class learning more ruby.
I am pretty comfortable with using Sinatra, git, and capyabara but my ruby knowledge is lacking. I can always figure out what to do using
rubydocs but I want to be comfortable enough that I don't have to touch it. We are taking an assessment monday on building a sinatra app.
