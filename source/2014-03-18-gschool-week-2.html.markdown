Class has been really exciting and challenging thus far. I am learning so much more in such a short span than I ever have before.
It is really nice to be fully immersed in something with a ton of people who are equally dedicated and excited to be here
every day.

So far we have learned git workflow, HTTP, some ruby, and how to write rspec tests.(I am sure I am forgetting plenty)

I am really excited to get into rails and build some apps.
I look forward to the rest of class.
