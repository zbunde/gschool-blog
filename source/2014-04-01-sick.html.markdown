I got the flu this weekend and spent Monday in bed. I think a plague is going around the class, a few people
have already gotten sick. I took an assessment on Sinatra from my bed with a 101 degree fever. It went terribly.
I redid it today and I think it was on point. This week we are finishing our URL shortener project but we are switching
pairing partners. I am interested to jump onto another anchor for a project and see how they may be building the app
differently.
